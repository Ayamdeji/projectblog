              <p>
                At 6ft 4in, Badiashile is a dominant defender in the air but
                equally comfortable with the ball at his feet, capable of
                playing short passes out from the back or switching the play
                with longer diagonals. His blistering speed is a key attribute
                and he has experience in both a back four and back three at club
                level.
